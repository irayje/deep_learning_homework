# Predictor Results:

### Which model has a lower loss?
The closing stock price predictor had a lower loss. Deviating a lot less from the actual results. 


### Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
The closing stock price predictor was better at predicting actual values over time. The trends of highs and lows were much closer than the FNG predcitor. The FNG had very little change over time and was closer to a flat line and not aligning with actual results.


### Which window size works best for the model?
The best window size was around 3-6 days. Any more and it started to feel like it was overfitted for the data.
